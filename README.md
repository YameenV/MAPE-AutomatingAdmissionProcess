# MAPE-AutomatingAdmissionProcess
Today all the work at the admission of the student is done manually by
ink and paper, which is very slow and time consuming. Every year,
students from different cities come to collect forms and then again to
submit the forms. This results in long queues during the admission
period. And if they misunderstood the nature of the documents asked
they would have to report the entire process again. This proves to be
laborious for both the students and the admin department. Also
managing and maintaining these applications requires a lot of
manpower. A poor admissions system can mean fewer students being
admitted into a university because of mistakes or an overly slow
response time.
In order to overcome all these problems, the online admission system is
developed.
The goal of "MAPE" is to automate the Academic Institute's admission
structures and its related operation and functionality. The objective of
the system is to provide support to the administration and students by
providing a faster, transparent and easy way of keeping records and use
them for further preceding.
